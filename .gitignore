# Ignore any file larger than 100MB (as an additional safeguard)
# Git does not support a direct way to ignore files by size in .gitignore, but you can use Git attributes to prevent large files from being committed:
# Use the command below in your terminal to exclude large files from being committed:
# git config --global filter.largefile.clean "test $(wc -c <\"$1\") -gt 104857600 && echo 'File is too large (> 100MB) and cannot be committed' && exit 1 || cat"

# Manually add large files here that are common in your project but are not already included in the above patterns.
